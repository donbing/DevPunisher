* do something about Build.With(IRocketLauncherService), can we ctor inject from deserializer? 
  current state is probly not really all that bad for now :(

* modify autogeneration of freestyleBuild classes to call directly to hudson and get schema from there rather than using the static xml examples :)

* add an unknown build state for when fetching build data fails ?
  deal with unknown build state in client

* find where the lost missile launcher tests went and put the back in the sln
  they're higdden in the root tf the build service tests!

* sometimes we may have > 1 culprit elements in build xml, deal with this somehow

* maybe only put culprit on failed build class and have dev name on others?

* dont pass rocket launcher service client to the dev punisher, wrap it in a notifier interface/impl
  so we can add other stuff (flashy lights, noises, general mayhem :)
  esp like greg youngs suggestion that we have a countdown timer...

* implement position tracking missile launcher :)
  write targetting system for position tracking launcher se we can headshot the culprit
  
* how to test xmlfetcher? cant get a buildnumber that's always valid :(
  - maybe this should be part of a full integratio test?
  
* build fetcher tests are using static xml examples, maybe fix this somehow?
